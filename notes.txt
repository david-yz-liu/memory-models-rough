Changes in this branch:

- Having made all "draw" functions return the dimensions and location of the drawn box, we also need to update to the implementation of the drawAll function, to return a list of the SIZE's (locations and dimensions) of the produced boxes. The returned list will be parallel to the inputted list; that is, the first element of the inputted list will be an object, and the first element of the returned list will by the SIZE of that (drawn) object.
	(to do this, I also added return statements to the drawObject method, which was required 	but we forgot to do)

# MemoryViz CLI

You can run MemoryViz straight from your terminal!

## Input

To run the MemoryViz CLI, run:

```console
$ npx memory-viz <path-to-file>
```

replacing `<path-to-file>` with the path to a file containing MemoryViz-compatible JSON. If the file extension is not `.json` or if the file content is not compatible with MemoryViz, an error will be thrown.

## Output

The output is an SVG image generated by MemoryViz and the image is saved in the same folder in which the CLI is called. The name of the SVG will be the same as that of the inputted file (i.e., if the inputted file is `david-is-cool.json`, the output will be `david-is-cool.svg`).
